CREDITS:
This game was developed by Anatoly Zavyalov and Jonathan Sumabat, from September 2018 to January 2019.

Since Jonathan Sumabat does not have a Windows-based machine, he was not able to effectively add new content without graphical feedback. 
Therefore, he was mainly assisting with more complex algorithms used in the program, as well as being a consultant when it came to code and general decisions.
