We used pseudocode, which is an industry-standard methodology, to create the world generation algorithm for chunks in the world. This was made before we made the world generation algorithm, just to get us started.

void (y, x, type):
	if the square at y,x has a biome type of none and it hasn't been found:
		square found = true

		declare type

		declare water and ground variables

		if its the first chunk:
			if the desired type is none or fits the chance of the water and ground variables, set new type, otherwise use old type
		if its not the first chunk in the y:
			take from the top chunk
		if its 	not the first chunk in the x:
			take from the left chunk
		otherwise 
			if the desired type is none or fits the chance of the water and ground variables, set new type, otherwise use old type

		square set type to type

		switch random int from 1,5:
		case 1:
			goes recursively left, right, up, down
		case 2:
			goes recursively right, left, up, down
		case 3:
			goes recursively up, left, right, down
		case 4:
			goes recursively down, left, right, up
